# Objective of this folder:

**This is personal note/reminder**  

- DIA-Forked folder is to experiment/explore with github forked repos.
- Readme, code update, what worked, what didn't and why is available in those respective folders.
- Solution there is repo or library specific.
- When I am exploring solution for something which cannot be solved using one repo that can convert into a POC and that will move into DIA-Project folder.
- This folder doesn't contains code.
- This contains only readme and experiment documents, which I create during experiments.
- Generally these kind of documents are within dia-project or dia-forked folder but when starting or when concluding or when things becomes too complex and I need to develop more understanding then some of the work move into this folder.
- This is mix of Dia-Project, Dia-Forked, Dia-Techstack.
- **Keep this folder as much lean as possible.**
