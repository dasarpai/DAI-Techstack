Thus it is the sun himself, who, drenched by the lunar influence, is transformed,\n","upon the sprouting of seeds, into holy vegetable furnished with the six tastes. And it is these which constitute the food of all creatures upon the earth.\n","Thus the food that supporteth the lives of creatures is instinct with solar energy, and the sun is, therefore, the father of all creatures.\n","Do thou, hence, O Yudhishthira, take refuge even in him. All illustrious monarchs of pure descent and deeds are known to have delivered their people by practising high asceticism.\n","The great Karttavirya, and Vainya and Nahusha, had all, by virtue of ascetic meditation preceded by vows, delivered their people from heavy afflictions.\n","Therefore, O virtuous one, as thou art purified by the acts do thou likewise, entering upon a file of austerities.
