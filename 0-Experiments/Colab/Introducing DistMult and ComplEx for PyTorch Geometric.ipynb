In this post, we’ll walk you through the intuition behind DistMult and ComplEx, and show you how to use PyG to implement these techniques, and explore some practical applications of knowledge graph embeddings in graph machine learning. So, get ready to take your graph analysis skills to the next level with DistMult and ComplEx in PyG!\n","\n","-
