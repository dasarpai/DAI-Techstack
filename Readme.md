Icons in above diagram are beautiful, catchy and attractive. They represents company or product. Each product has its own complexity and when we develop the solution we need to look different permutations and combinations of these technologies.

This repository is not about business solutions but technical products and technical problem solved by any specific product.

This repository is a collection of my experiments, exploration, and proof-of-concept (POC) projects. It serves my personal purposes, but if others find it beneficial, they are welcome to explore and connect the dots.

When interacting with my students, clients, and developing solutions, I often need a reference point to build upon. This repository serves that purpose. Sometimes, ideas from here evolve into full-fledged courses or solutions, while other times, they help me gain clarity about different components and how they work together.

This repo has following POC work, they deal with different technologies.
